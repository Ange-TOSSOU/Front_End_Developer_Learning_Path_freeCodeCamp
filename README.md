# Front End Developer Roadmap
This is the freeCodeCamp course on Front End Development. It deals with all of the key technologies you need to learn. Like HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SASS, React and more.

Find out more about this course [here][mooc_material].

The course is project-based, so it contains a bunch of projects for help you practice Front End development.
I created this repository to store all my codes related to this course.
